# implementation_of_datastructure_in_java
In this project, implementation of the following data structures using various features of Java
language is done:
a) Stack- using arrays as well as linked list.
b) Queue- using arrays as well as linked list. Also linear and circular implementation is
shown.
c) Linked list- both singly and doubly linked lists. Also circular linked lists are implemented.
d) Binary search tree- using the same Node class as doubly linked list.

Also, 4 exception classes are been added:
1) StackFullException- To handle the exception when stack is full.
2) StackEmptyException- To handle the exception when stack is empty.
3) QueueFullException- To handle the exception when queue is full.
4) QueueEmptyException- To handle the exception when queue is empty.
